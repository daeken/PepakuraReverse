Introduction
============

Pepakura is a very popular piece of software for translating a 3d model into a series of paper elements that can be printed and cut out, to rebuild said model.  Unfortunately, it's Windows-only and the file format has thus far been completely unknown.

I've reverse-engineered the entire file structure, but most of the contents of the data are currently unknown.  Feel free to look through the files I've included, along with the structure, and figure things out.

Pull requests are appreciated!

Scripts
=======

There are a number of scripts included in the repo:

- loader.py - Takes a PDO file and outputs YAML
- unlock.py - Takes a locked PDO file and outputs a (currently broken) unlocked PDO file
- stl.py - Takes a generated YAML file and outputs an STL model (I think this is fully functional?)
- linedraw.py - Takes a generated YAML file and outputs an HTML file that draws the shapes (Partially functional)

Data Types
==========

All content is little endian

- uint8, uint16, uint32 - Unsigned integers of various bit lengths
- wstr - UTF-8 string, prefixed with uint32 length in bytes
	- For "locked" files, the value `key` (inside the first 'if locked') gets subtracted from each byte to "decrypt" it
- float, double - 32-bit and 64-bit floating point values, respectively; standard IEEE 754 floats
- bytes - Simply a C string for convenience
- array - This means there's a uint32 count, then that many children, one indent level in
